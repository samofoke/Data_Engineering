# Data_Engineering

### All topics relating to data, also including Python concpets.

#### "Python allows you to split your program into modules that can be reused in other Python programs. It comes with a large collection of standard modules that you can use as the basis of your programs â€” or as examples to start learning to program in Python. Some of these modules provide things like file I/O, system calls, sockets, and even interfaces to graphical user interface toolkits like Tk."

#### "Python is an interpreted language, which can save you considerable time during program development because no compilation and linking is necessary. The interpreter can be used interactively, which makes it easy to experiment with features of the language, to write throw-away programs, or to test functions during bottom-up program development."

### The Zen of Python, by Tim Peters

     Beautiful is better than ugly.
     Explicit is better than implicit.
     Simple is better than complex.
     Complex is better than complicated.
     Flat is better than nested.
     Sparse is better than dense.
     Readability counts.
     Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules.
     Although practicality beats purity.
     Errors should never pass silently.
     Unless explicitly silenced.
     In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.
     There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it.
     Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch.
     Now is better than never.
     Although never is often better than *right* now.
     If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea.
     If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea.
     Namespaces are one honking great idea -- let's do more of those!

#### Data types and operators
  * Variables in pythong.
    ~~~
     x = 2
     x = 3

     this allows us to access variales using x or y in this case which holds values
     2 and 3.
    ~~~
  * assignment operators in python.
    ~~~
    we have:
    =      x = 2
    -=     x -= 2 or x = x - 2
    +=     x += 2 or x = x + 2
    ~~~
  * integers and floats
    ~~~
    x = int(3.0)
    y = float(3)

    we can try checking a type of a value by running:
    s = 4.5
    type(s)

    we also look at logical operators:

    and
    or
    not

    touching on Strings:
    Strings in Python are shown as the variable type str. You can define a string with either double quotes " or single quotes '. If the string you are creating actually has one of these two values in it, then you need to be careful to assure your code doesn't give an error.
    you can even add strings together by using operators.
